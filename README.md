# Adminbypass
This script allows Windows executables that require admin rights to be opened by skipping the UAC prompt.
The code is self-explanatory, so I'll not explain it here.
Just drag a .exe file onto the script icon and It'll skip the UAC prompt. Although please note that this will *not* give any help when the executable needs admin rights.
